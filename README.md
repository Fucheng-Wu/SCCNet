# SCCNet:Spatial-and-Channel Calibration Networks
**PyTorch implementation of the paper "SCCNet:Spatial-and-Channel Calibration Networks".**  

![SCCNet](https://github.com/Fucheng-Wu/SCCNet/blob/main/images/SCCNet.jpg "The network structure of SCCNet.")  
The process of extracting features is done in four stages, each of which contains a downsampling module and an SCC block. GAP denotes the global average pooling layer and FC denotes the fully connected layer. For simplicity, the normalization layer and activation layer are omitted in the figure.
